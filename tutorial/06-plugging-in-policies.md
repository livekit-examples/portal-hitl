# 6. Plugging in a policy

A policy is just another `Operator`. It loads the same `portal.yaml`,
subscribes to observations, and sends one action per tick. The
Portal-facing flow is identical regardless of which model class is
behind `select_action`. The two examples in this repo are
`policies/act/inference.py` and `policies/diffusion/inference.py`.

This page walks the per-tick flow that policies use.

## Why per-tick, not action chunks

Portal ships an `add_action_chunk(...)` declaration for VLA-style
horizons. We do not use it here. The lerobot policies (ACT, Diffusion,
SmolVLA, VQBeT) all expose `policy.select_action(batch)` returning a
single action. They handle chunk buffering and temporal ensembling
internally.

So the wire schema stays flat: `action` only, no `action_chunks` in
`portal.yaml`. One tick, one `op.send_action(...)`.

## The tick body

Stripped of model-specific code, every `policies/<algo>/inference.py`
runs this loop:

```python
async for _ in pace(fps):
    obs = latest_obs                 # written by on_observation callback
    if obs is None:
        continue                     # robot warming up

    # 1. Build the model batch from the synced observation.
    state_typed = dict(obs.state)
    frames = {
        cam: frame_bytes_to_numpy_rgb(obs.frames[cam])
        for cam in policy_cameras
        if cam in obs.frames
    }
    batch = build_batch(state_typed, frames, policy_cameras, task_prompt)

    # 2. Run the policy.
    processed = preprocessor(batch)
    with torch.inference_mode():
        action_t = policy.select_action(processed)
    action_t = postprocessor(action_t)

    # 3. Reshape back to a dict and send.
    action = {k: float(v) for k, v in zip(ACTION_KEYS, action_t.tolist())}
    op.send_action(
        action,
        timestamp_us=int(time.time() * 1_000_000),
        in_reply_to_ts_us=obs.timestamp_us,
    )
```

Three steps: build batch, run inference, send. `in_reply_to_ts_us=obs.timestamp_us`
is what closes the e2e latency loop (see [05. Handoff](05-handoff.md)).

## Self-claim and the safety gate

Policies self-claim on connect by default so a fresh autonomous run
just works:

```python
await op.connect(url, token)
me = op.local_identity()
if args.self_claim:
    await op.set_active_operator(me)
```

The `engaged` flag layered on top is a safety: SPACE toggles whether
we actually call `op.send_action` (we always run inference and log to
rerun). Starts disengaged.

```python
engaged = False
async for _ in pace(fps):
    if poll_key() == " ":
        engaged = not engaged

    # ... build batch, run policy, get action ...

    if engaged:
        op.send_action(action, ...)
```

Two reasons for the engaged gate even though the active-operator gate
exists:

1. The teleoperator can mid-session cycle to us and the gate would
   pass our actions. The engaged flag is a local kill switch the
   operator owns regardless of who is active.
2. We log inference outputs to rerun even when disengaged, which is
   useful for visualizing what the policy *would* do without letting
   it actually drive.

## Field ordering

The `STATE_KEYS` and `ACTION_KEYS` constants in each policy are
alphabetical:

```python
STATE_KEYS = (
    "elbow_flex.pos",
    "gripper.pos",
    "shoulder_lift.pos",
    "shoulder_pan.pos",
    "wrist_flex.pos",
    "wrist_roll.pos",
    "wrist_yaw.pos",
)
ACTION_KEYS = STATE_KEYS
```

That ordering matches what `LeRobotDataset.create` writes for the
`names` list at dataset creation time. The policy was trained with
this order, so the action tensor it returns is indexed this way.
Reordering would silently mis-route values to the wrong motors.

## Adding a new policy

Copy `policies/act/inference.py` as a starting point. Replace:

- The model class (`ACTPolicy.from_pretrained`).
- The model-specific runtime knobs (temporal ensembler for ACT, async
  chunk wrapper for Diffusion).
- The CLI arguments.

Keep:

- The Portal flow (connect, on_observation slot, per-tick build batch
  + send_action).
- The `engaged` gate.
- The `--no-claim` flag for HITL setups.
- The `STATE_KEYS` / `ACTION_KEYS` definitions, unless your training
  data has a different field set.

The training side (`policies/<algo>/train.py`) is independent of
Portal. It is just lerobot training driven by `runpy`, with a few
shims for object-storage symlinks and worker prefetch. Adapt the
flags for your model, leave the rest.

That is the whole pattern. The robot side never changes.
