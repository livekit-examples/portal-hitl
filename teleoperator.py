"""Operator side: reBot 102 leader + HITL recorder + rerun viewer.

Hardware lives in ``utils/rebot.py``. Rerun blueprint and per-tick
log helpers live in ``utils/rerun_view.py``. The hotkey listener lives
in ``utils/hotkeys.py``. The recorder lives in ``utils/recorder.py``.

Two YAML knobs (set in ``portal.yaml``) carry the wire-quality
contract for this side:

* ``action_subscription: true``. ``on_action`` fires for every action
  the robot's gate forwards, regardless of sender. Without it the
  recorder would only see actions we sent, not ones from a remote
  policy during HITL handoff. Each action carries ``Action.sender``
  so dataset rows can be labelled correctly.
* ``reuse_stale_frames: true``. The synchronizer reuses the last
  good frame on a track when the current state has no fresh frame
  within the sync window, instead of holding the state. State drives
  obs emission; frames are best-effort. Without this a transient
  camera drop punches holes in the recording. With it the dataset
  retains every tick, paying at most a one or two tick visual lag
  during loss.

Recording is driven by ``on_action``. One executed action gives one
dataset row, paired with the observation the operator was responding
to (anchored by ``in_reply_to_ts_us`` when the operator passed it,
otherwise by the action's send timestamp). With reuse_stale_frames on,
the sync delay is small and predictable, and actions always arrive at
this operator after the obs they reference. So a simple "find newest
obs <= target_ts" reconciliation is correct for steady state. The
``PORTAL_HITL_MAX_OBS_AGE_MS`` threshold (default 100ms) covers the
corner case where a state packet's wire transport is jittered enough
to flip the order; mismatched pairs are dropped and counted.

Hotkeys:
  c: cycle the active operator through ``[self, *remote_operators]``,
     wrapping back to self.
  r: toggle episode recording.
  [: discard the in-flight episode.
  x: clean quit.
